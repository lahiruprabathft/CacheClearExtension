2. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to the extensions management page by entering `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.

3. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch located at the top right corner of the extensions management page.

4. Locate the existing version of the extension in the list of installed extensions and click on the "Remove" button to uninstall it.

8. Click "Open" to load the updated extension. The new version should now appear in the list of installed extensions.

9. Verify that the extension is updated by checking any new features, changes, or improvements mentioned in the release notes or update documentation.
